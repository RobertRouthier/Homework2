# Homework2
First I built out my different parts of the portfolio including a header with a nav, and three sections;

Linked the different id's on the page so the buttons in the nav scrolls smoothly to the different sections of the page;

I included a little bit about myself, a screen shot of my portfolio, and links to my github, email, and linkedin;

I styled the page with some fonts, background color, and text color;

I made sure to include accessible code for web crawlers;

I did my best to have my page represent myself with a picture of me with one of my best friends Evan, as well as a background color that is orange, which is one of my favorite colors;

It is definitely a work in progress, and I cannot wait to continue to add more about me, my accomplishments, and more of my work;
